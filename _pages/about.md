Doumo("Hey" in Japanese)!

Welcome to my personal page.

I am a Data Analyst and MSc student at Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University. I am current developing my research interest, for now it is model generalization (too broad).
I am looking for opportunities in ML Research to my career as an ML researcher.
